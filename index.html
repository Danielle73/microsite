        <p class="answerSlide"> What I've always stood for is being a lifelong learner. I've always believed that it's never too late to learn something new and that being curious in life is essential to both professional and personal growth.</p> 
        <p class="answerSlide">Professionally, this mindset helped me to find the courage to pivot my career into coding and development. After years in customer service and marketing, I discovered coding, and realised it offered the perfect blend between creativity and tech that I was looking for in the next stage of my career.</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">Though coding initially seemed daunting, it has been a fulfilling experience. Completing a bootcamp confirmed the enjoyment I found in being a developer, whilst providing invaluable insight into working in developer teams, learning best practices, and gaining confidence in sharing ideas. Recently I was a frontend intern at Vsphera, which further deepened my love for frontend, but also exposed me to working with new tools, such as Storybook, in a dynamic environment</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">I've also looked at development in other ways, more specifically, accessibility and inclusive design. In fact, learning about accessibility has really broadened my horizons in how I now approach development in personal projects. Furthermore, it inspired me to share my own learnings in my blog about the importance of inclusivity on the web.</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">Personally, my curiosity for life saw me through six months solo travel across South East Asia, Australasia and New Zealand. From wading through thigh high water of the mekong delta that had burst earlier in the day, to jumping 15,000ft out of an airplane over Lake Taupo, travelling was incredibly transformative, and gave me a new found sense of assuredness in who I am and how I achieve my personal goals. Currently I’m enrolled in a British Sign Language course (BSL), which is something I have been interested in for years, reflecting my belief that it's never too late to learn. </p>
