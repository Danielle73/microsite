        <p class="answerSlide">What I&apos;ve always stood for is being a lifelong learner. I&apos;ve always believed that it&apos;s never too late to learn something new, and that being curious in life is essential to both professional and personal growth.</p> 
        <p class="answerSlide">Professionally, this mindset helped me find the courage to pivot my career into coding and development. After years in customer service and marketing, I discovered coding and realised it offered the perfect blend of creativity and tech that I was looking for in the next stage of my career.</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">Though coding initially seemed daunting, it has been a fulfilling experience. Completing a bootcamp confirmed the enjoyment I found in being a developer, whilst providing invaluable insight into working in development teams, learning best practices, and gaining confidence in sharing ideas. More recently, I was a front-end intern at Vsphera, which further deepened my love for front-end development, while also exposing me to working with new tools, such as Storybook, in a dynamic environment.</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">I&apos;ve also explored development from other perspectives, more specifically accessibility and inclusive design. Learning about accessibility has really broadened my horizons in how I now approach development in personal projects. Furthermore, it inspired me to share my learnings on my blog about the importance of inclusivity on the web.</p>
        <p class="answerSlide">Personally, my curiosity for life saw me through six months of solo travel across South-East Asia, Australasia, and New Zealand. From wading through thigh-high water in the Mekong Delta after it burst its banks earlier in the day, to jumping 15,000 ft out of an aeroplane over Lake Taupo, travelling was incredibly transformative and gave me a newfound sense of assurance in who I am and how I achieve my personal goals. Currently, I&apos;m enrolled in a British Sign Language (BSL) course, which is something I have been interested in for years, reflecting my belief that it&apos;s never too late to learn.</p>
